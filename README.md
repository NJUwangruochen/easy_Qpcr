Introduction：This program can help calculate Quantitative real-time PCR from Roche Lightcycler 96 !
(bases on △△Ct method)                       ------------***-------------   -----------***----------

Usage:

run main.py: A new window will pop up and you can start to calculate relative expression level of your interest gene
             1.Enter the number of the repeat loading samples in the box "repeat loading" 
             2.Choose your data file by click the button "select file"
             3.Copy the mean Ct values of reference gene and the mean Ct values of interest gene, and paste them into the corresponding two text boxes respectivly("Reference gene","Interest gene")
             4.Enter the number of the control samples in the box---"number of control groups"
             5.Click the button "'Result" and get the final result
